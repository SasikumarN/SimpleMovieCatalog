Simple Movie Catalog 1.1.1
Copyright (C) 2008 damien.langg@gmail.com

Simple Movie Catalog will scan a given directory for movies,
query imdb for info and generate a catalog in html which offers
sorting and grouping of found movies by different criteria.



Install Instructions:
=====================

* Windows:

   1. Install Perl
      Simple Movie Catalog is written in perl so you'll have to install it first.
      Download from: http://www.activestate.com/Products/activeperl/
      Or install cygwin, which includes perl (http://www.cygwin.com/)
      Make sure to have perl in PATH!

   2. Install Simple Movie Catalog
      Download SimpleMovieCatalog.zip and unpack to a directory of your liking.
      (example: C:\Program Files\SimpleMovieCatalog)

   3. Run
      Drag&drop a directory to run_scan.cmd or edit config.txt and start run_scan.cmd
      The directory will be scanned, html report generated and opened using your
      favorite web browser.

* Linux:

      Unpack, edit config.txt and run:
      $ perl moviecat.pl -c config.txt
      Open report/movies.html with your favorite browser.

      Note: the packaged text files are in msdos format.
      Convert them to unix format with:
      $ dos2unix *.txt doc/*.txt



How does it work?
=================

The directories are scanned for: *.nfo, *.txt, *.url, *.desktop files that
contain links to imdb info like this: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/

If no such link is present then the movie title and year is guessed from
directory name and searched on imdb for an exact match.

If none of the above methods produce valid info, then the directory is
reported in the "Missing Info" group.

You can then resolve missing info for these directories by using one of
the following methods:

 - Find the movie on imdb and then drag&drop the link from your
   browser location bar to the directory containing the movie.
   This will create a .url file (.desktop on linux) in that directory.

 - To make guessing work better rename the directory to use the format:
   "Title (Year) [optional additional info]"
   Guessing will only use Title and Year. Year is mandatory and anything
   following year is ignored.

 - Manually create a .nfo or .txt file in the directory and put
   the imdb link inside.

 - Use the interactive mode to search and assign movies to directories.

 - Or choose to ignore the directory by using the -ignore or -skip options
   or using the ignoredir command in interactive mode.

After the info is added you need to re-run the scan to update the html report.

All imdb queries are cached in imdb_cache directory so running scan
multiple times is fast.

Config file:
============

All command line options can be used in a config file.
Use only one option per line, followed by optional arguments in same line.
Empty lines and lines starting with # are ignored.
Multimple config files can be specified or nested, so you can include the
ignore list generated by the interactive ignoredir commad with:
"-c ignore.txt" from the command line or from the config file.
See doc/sample-cfg.txt for an example.



Interactive mode:
=================

Start with -i option or run interactive.cmd to enter interactive mode.
In interactive mode, you can assign movies to directories which are missing
info (either missing a .nfo file or guessing didn't give an exact match).
